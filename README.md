## INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING
A web based Application to predict the attacks.
## About
Intruders can be divided into two groups, external and internal. The former refers to those who do not have authorized access to the system and who attack by using various penetration techniques.
There are two general categories of intrusion detection systems: misuse detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection system detects intruders with known patterns, and anomaly detection systems identify deviations from normal network behaviors and alert for potential unknown attacks.

## Result
In this project a genetic algorithm along with decision tree approach is deployed to intrusion detection. Software implementation of the proposed approach is presented. Genetic algorithm was employed to generate classification rules for intrusion detection while principal component analysis was used to identify the key features of network connections.
